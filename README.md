# ♻️ Biodegradable vs Non-Biodegradable Image Classification Web App

This project is a full-stack AI/ML web application designed to classify images as **Biodegradable** or **Non-Biodegradable** waste. It leverages a **TensorFlow Lite model** trained via **Google Teachable Machine** and is deployed using **Streamlit** for interactive user access.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to contribute to environmental awareness and sustainability by providing a lightweight, fast, and accessible AI tool to identify waste types based on uploaded images.

- 🧠 AI/ML: Image classification using TensorFlow Lite
- 🌐 Web Interface: Developed with Streamlit
- 📂 Input: Image uploaded by user (JPG, JPEG, PNG)
- 📤 Output: Predicted class with confidence score
- 📱 Deployment Ready: Compatible with Streamlit Cloud and other Python-based web platforms

## 🔍 Features

- 📤 File uploader to browse and upload images
- 🎯 Single-click prediction of the waste category
- 📈 Real-time confidence score displayed
- 💡 Clean and intuitive user interface
- ⚙️ Efficient inference using `.tflite` model

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User uploads an image of waste material.
2. The image is preprocessed and resized to match the model input.
3. The TFLite model classifies the image into one of the two categories:
   - **Biodegradable**
   - **Non-Biodegradable**
4. The result and confidence score are displayed instantly.
